        "- a [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), which combines the elements above (and has defaults for ``collate_fn`` and Sampler), and orchestrates the whole pipeline.\n",

You can write your own Dataset subclass or sometimes you can use a standardized class. The training, validation, and test subsets get their own Dataset instances.\n",

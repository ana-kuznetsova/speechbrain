    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "PyTorch data loading can run in many configurations,\n",
    "but a typical approach has these basic elements:\n",
    "- a [Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset), which loads data points one-at-a-time.\n",
    "- a [collation function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#dataloader-collate-fn), or ``collate_fn`` for short, which takes a list of data points and forms a batch.\n",
    "- a [Sampler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#data-loading-order-and-sampler), which determines the order in which the Dataset is iterated.\n",
    "- a [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), which combines the elements above (and has defaults for ``collate_fn`` and Sampler), and orchestrates the whole pipeline.\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "The role of the Dataset is to produce single data points. Typically they are loaded off the disk, but they could also come from some more complex source or in some cases just from RAM. You can write your own Dataset subclass or sometimes you can use a standardized class. The training, validation, and test subsets get their own Dataset instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset interface is simple; it implements\n",
    "`__getitem__` and usually also `__len__`. Usually, \"map-style\" Datasets are used, but it's worth noting that PyTorch also has a notion of [IterableDataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#iterable-style-datasets)s.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__getitem__` can return _anything_ because data can look like _anything_. Often, though, a data point consists of multiple associated things (e.g. an image and a label, or a speech waveform and its transcription). The Dataset should return all of these associated things.\n",
    "\n",

    "The iterator that DataLoader returns can either load batches in the same process that it is created in (`num_workers=0`), or it can start a new process (`num_workers=1`) or multiple new processes (`num_workers>1`). Because of the Global Interpreter Lock, Python cannot work on two tasks at the same time in a single process. Using at least one background worker process to load data while simultaneously running training is often essential for taking full advantage of GPU compute resources."

    "## SpeechBrain Basic dataIO\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic dataIO pipeline is organized around three \"key\" blocks: **DynamicItemDataset**, **Dynamic Items Pipelines (DIPs)**  and **CategoricalEncoder** which are tightly connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DynamicItemDataset** inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and has been built to work together with **Dynamic Items Pipelines** to provide a straightforward and flexible way to fetch and transform data and labels from the raw dataset stored in your disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DIPs** consists of user-defined functions in which the user specifies operations applied to metadata and data contained in the dataset. E.g. reading and augmenting an audio file or encoding a sequence of words using SentencePiece tokenizer.\n",
    "These functions are called inside **DynamicItemDataset** `__getitem__` method and are run in parallel on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CategoricalEncoder** is a convenient abstraction we provide for multi-class classification problems and it is sub-classed into **TextEncoder** and **CTCTextEncoder** which instead can be used for sequence-to-sequence applications related to text, such as ASR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to these abstractions, most of the work necessary to set up the data IO pipeline is parsing the dataset into suitable annotation supported by **DynamicItemDataset** (SpeechBrain supports both CSV and JSON formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this annotation is ready, a flexible and efficient pipeline can be created in few lines of code, as SpeechBrain will take care under the hood of padding and other operations."
